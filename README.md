# BookStore
This is a shopping site I created to challenge myself with a fullstack project.
This repository is for the frontend only and uses a backend server, which can be found
[here](https://github.com/Skinnero/BookShopBackend).

# What I used
* React.js
* Axios
* Js-cookie
* Jwt-decode
* Styled-components
* Qs

# Requirements
* Node.js 18.17.1 or newer
* Docker or Docker Compose
* Internet connection (Because it uses online link to fonts/icons)

# Set Up
```shell
docker build -t bs-front .
```
```shell
 docker run -p 3000:3000 -d bs-front
```

# Summary

Feel free to use it as you see fit.
It serves only as a project for me to prove myself in and I look forward to developing it
